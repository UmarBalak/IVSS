Intelligent Video Surveillance System

This project is an implementation of real-time object detection and abnormal event detection on video footage using OpenCV and deep learning models. It includes a script that loads pre-trained models to detect and track various objects, such as cars, animals, buildings and people, and counts their occurrences in a video. Additionally, it detects abnormal events based on changes in object movement and alerts the user. This project can be used as a starting point for developing a real-time surveillance system for traffic analysis, video analysis and abnormal event detection.
